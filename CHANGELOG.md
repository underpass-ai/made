# Changelog

All notable changes to the Underpass Choreographer are tracked here.

This repository has not cut a public `v*` tag yet. The workspace and
Helm chart currently carry version `0.1.0`; keep entries under
`Unreleased` until the release process in `docs/release.md` creates an
immutable tag and published artifacts.

The format follows the spirit of Keep a Changelog, with categories kept
short and factual. Do not add claims here unless the behavior is
implemented and covered by a committed gate, smoke test, or documented
operator command.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Product usability and publication planning:
  `docs/product-usability-publication-plan.md` and
  `docs/product-publication-checklist.md`.
- Explicit documentation that Choreographer is agnostic and
  independently usable; KMP, PIR, Runtime, and other projects are study
  cases or optional integrations, not required dependencies.
- Local no-external-service quickstart:
  `CHOREO_NATS_ENABLED=false just run`.
- MCP fixture and live-gRPC quickstarts, plus examples for
  `CreateCouncil`, `RegisterAgent`, `RegisterContract`,
  `RunCouncilDecision`, and `Orchestrate`.
- Repo-owned compose E2E guide covering the nine scenarios, stubs,
  Report schema, and provider-shaped OpenAI/vLLM paths.
- E2E runner scenario selection through `CHOREO_E2E_SCENARIOS`, with
  groups for `compose`, `cluster-connectivity`, `runtime-stub`, and
  `structured-output`.
- Consumer smoke `positive-path`, including Report contract
  registration, Strict-mode `RunCouncilDecision`, provider-shaped
  OpenAI/vLLM agents, and optional NATS causality assertions.
- Helm install profiles for minimal standalone, embedded NATS,
  Postgres DSN from Secret, provider environment Secret wiring, and the
  Underpass Runtime executor profile.
- Kubernetes deployment guide covering minimal install, embedded NATS,
  gRPC TLS/mTLS, Postgres secret sourcing, provider environment
  secrets, Runtime executor TLS, and operator smokes.
- Support matrix covering Rust toolchain, image tags, chart versions,
  provider adapters, and Kubernetes posture.
- Upgrade, rollback, and operator deploy verification runbooks for
  pinned images, Secret references, OCI chart installs, and smoke
  checks.
- Security policy covering supported scope, private vulnerability
  reporting, coordinated disclosure, deployment hardening, and secret
  containment.

### Changed

- Kubernetes E2E jobs default to cluster-connectivity scenarios instead
  of running fixture-only stub scenarios against real deployments.
- `make e2e-compose` keeps the full compose group as the fixture-backed
  end-to-end path.
- Helm render checks now cover pinned-image enforcement, TLS secret
  validation, embedded NATS wiring, Runtime executor failure modes,
  Postgres Secret rendering, and provider env Secret rendering.

### Validation

- MCP catalog parity is checked against the gRPC proto surface.
- Compose E2E has been validated through all nine scenarios, including
  structured Report output and provider-shaped paths.
- Kubernetes smoke has been validated with the selected
  cluster-connectivity group.
- `choreo-consumer-smoke` has been validated for rejection-path and
  positive-path behavior against local Choreographer, NATS, and
  `choreo-stub-llm`.

### Security

- Provider credentials, Postgres DSNs, and TLS materials are documented
  as secret-managed inputs, not values-file or descriptor content.
- Chart gates assert hardened pod defaults and prevent accidental
  rendering of literal Postgres DSNs in the Secret-backed profile.

### Known Limits

- No public immutable `v*` tag, release image, OCI chart, or crates.io
  package has been cut yet; current published `sha-*` images are RC
  smoke artifacts, not stable release artifacts.
- `choreo-mcp` can only be published after `choreo-mcp-proto v0.1.0`
  is available in crates.io.
- Provider-backed positive smokes are validated with deterministic
  OpenAI-compatible stubs unless a real provider is explicitly wired by
  the operator.
- The Helm chart does not manage Ingress, provider egress allow-lists,
  or multi-replica/state coordination beyond the documented single
  replica posture.

## 0.1.0 - Pending

- Initial pre-release version present in `Cargo.toml` and
  `charts/choreographer/Chart.yaml`.
- No immutable `v0.1.0` tag is present in this checkout yet.
